Depending on this decision, you are accessing Camunda via REST or Java API. While Camunda Engine Core API provides well-designed and easy-accessible programming interface for Java, the usage of REST interface requires additional development. In order to enable the usage of REST API from Java and allow for easy integration into Spring Boot applications, the Camunda REST Client Spring-Boot library has been developed. So instead of usage a hand-written or generated client, this library provides you the same access to a remote Camunda engine as the Java API provides to local Camunda. The difference between using and being disappears.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"introduction/solution.html","text":"The library uses the popular Java REST client OpenFeign embedded into Spring-Cloud-Feign-Starter and provides implementations of Java Camunda Engine Core API , accessing the remote engine via REST API.

If any errors occur on this access, Camunda REST API will send with corresponding HTTP error code and embed information about the error into http response. camunda-rest-client-spring-boot tries to parse this response and throw an exception on the client side similar to the original exception thrown on the remote Camunda Engine. By default, the library tries to decode HTTP codes and will throw a RemoteProcessEngineException . If the response decoding was successful, the cause of the thrown RemoteProcessEngineException will be the instance of the exception class thrown on remote Camunda engine and the reason of the latter exception will be the original reason from the server. If anything goes wrong on HTTP error decoding, the RemoteProcessEngineException will contain a generic message extracted from the REST call. If the error decoding is deactivated, FeignException is wrapping any exception occurring during the remote access.
