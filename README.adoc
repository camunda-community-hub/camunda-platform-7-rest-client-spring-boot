== Introduction

This library aims to provide a REST client for Camunda REST API for SpringBoot. In doing so it offers "remote" implementations of Camunda
Engine Java API. This project is highly iterative and releases the functionality in small increments. Please check the link:https://camunda-community-hub.github.io/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-spring-boot/snapshot/user-guide/support-matrix.html[support matrix]
to find out if the functionality you require is already supported by the library.


== Quick Start

If you just want to start using the library, please consult our link:https://camunda-community-hub.github.io/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-spring-boot/snapshot/getting-started.html[Quick Start]
guide.

== Working Example

We provide a working example demonstrating some features of the library. See our link:https://camunda-community-hub.github.io/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-spring-boot/snapshot/user-guide/examples.html#standalone-usage[Examples] section for usage and configuration.


== User Guide

If you have any questions regarding configuration of Camunda BPM Feign please
have a look at our link:https://camunda-community-hub.github.io/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-spring-boot/snapshot/user-guide/index.html[User Guide].

== Direct usage of feign clients

You can also just use the generated feign clients directly and not via the Camunda services.
If you're interested have a look at the link:https://camunda-community-hub.github.io/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-spring-boot/snapshot/user-guide/examples.html#usage-of-feign-clients[Examples] section for usage and configuration.
